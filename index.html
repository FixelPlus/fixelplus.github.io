        <div class="pdiv">
        <p>Hello! I'm Elchin, an aspiring future software engineer.
          I was born In Azerbaijan and raised in Russia.
          Since very little age I was interested in languages and different cultures.
          My father, an English language teacher, introduced me to both of my non-native languages when I was young.
          I am a current student at CUNY Brooklyn College.
          Majoring in Computer Science and focusing my attention on full-stack development.
          Nowadays I enjoy mathematics and programming.
          I'm very excited about Artificial Intelligence and Computational Linguistics,
          in particular, such areas of studying as NLP(Natural Language Processing) and ASR(Automatic Speech Recognition).
